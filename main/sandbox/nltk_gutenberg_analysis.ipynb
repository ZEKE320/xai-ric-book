And do you now put on your best attyre ? And do you now cull out a Holyday ? And do you now strew Flowers in his way , That comes in Triumph ouer Pompeyes blood ?

Vexed I am Of late , with passions of some difference , Conceptions onely proper to my selfe , Which giue some soyle ( perhaps ) to my Behauiours : But let not therefore my good Friends be greeu ' d ( Among which number Cassius be you one ) Nor construe any further my neglect , Then that poore Brutus with himselfe at warre , Forgets the shewes of Loue to other men\n",
      "Cassi . Then Brutus , I haue much mistook your passion , By meanes whereof , this Brest of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value , worthy Cogitations . Tell me good Brutus , Can you see your face ? Brutus . No Cassius : For the eye sees not it selfe but by reflection , By some other things\n",
      "Cassius . ' Tis iust , And it is very much lamented Brutus , That you haue no such Mirrors , as will turne Your hidden worthinesse into your eye , That you might see your shadow : I haue heard , Where many of the best respect in Rome , ( Except immortall Caesar ) speaking of Brutus , And groaning vnderneath this Ages yoake , Haue wish ' d , that Noble Brutus had his eyes\n",
      "Bru . Into what dangers , would you Leade me Cassius ? That you would haue me seeke into my selfe , For that which is not in me ? Cas . Therefore good Brutus , be prepar ' d to heare : And since you know , you cannot see your selfe So well as by Reflection ; I your Glasse , Will modestly discouer to your selfe That of your selfe , which you yet know not of . And be not iealous on me , gentle Brutus : Were I a common Laughter , or did vse To stale with ordinary Oathes my loue To euery new Protester : if you know , That I do fawne on men , and hugge them hard , And after scandall them : Or if you know , That I professe my selfe in Banquetting To all the Rout , then hold me dangerous .\n",

      "Bru . I would not Cassius , yet I loue him well : But wherefore do you hold me heere so long ? What is it , that you would impart to me ? If it be ought toward the generall good , Set Honor in one eye , and Death i ' th other , And I will looke on both indifferently : For let the Gods so speed mee , as I loue The name of Honor , more then I feare death\n",
      "Cassi . I know that vertue to be in you Brutus , As well as I do know your outward fauour . Well , Honor is the subiect of my Story : I cannot tell , what you and other men Thinke of this life : But for my single selfe , I had as liefe not be , as liue to be In awe of such a Thing , as I my selfe . I was borne free as Caesar , so were you , We both haue fed as well , and we can both Endure the Winters cold , as well as hee . For once , vpon a Rawe and Gustie day , The troubled Tyber , chafing with her Shores , Caesar saide to me , Dar ' st thou Cassius now Leape in with me into this angry Flood , And swim to yonder Point ? Vpon the word , Accoutred as I was , I plunged in , And bad him follow : so indeed he did . The Torrent roar ' d , and we did buffet it With lusty Sinewes , throwing it aside , And stemming it with hearts of Controuersie . But ere we could arriue the Point propos ' d , Caesar cride , Helpe me Cassius , or I sinke . I ( as Aeneas , our great Ancestor , Did from the Flames of Troy , vpon his shoulder The old Anchyses beare ) so , from the waues of Tyber Did I the tyred Caesar : And this Man , Is now become a God , and Cassius is A wretched Creature , and must bend his body , If Caesar carelesly but nod on him . He had a Feauer when he was in Spaine , And when the Fit was on him , I did marke How he did shake : Tis true , this God did shake , His Coward lippes did from their colour flye , And that same Eye , whose bend doth awe the World , Did loose his Lustre : I did heare him grone : I , and that Tongue of his , that bad the Romans Marke him , and write his Speeches in their Bookes , Alas , it cried , Giue me some drinke Titinius , As a sicke Girle : Ye Gods , it doth amaze me , A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the Maiesticke world , And beare the Palme alone .\n",
      "Shout . Flourish .\n",
      "Bru . Another generall shout ? I do beleeue , that these applauses are For some new Honors , that are heap ' d on Caesar\n",
      "Cassi . Why man , he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus , and we petty men Walke vnder his huge legges , and peepe about To finde our selues dishonourable Graues . Men at sometime , are Masters of their Fates . The fault ( deere Brutus ) is not in our Starres , But in our Selues , that we are vnderlings . Brutus and Caesar : What should be in that Caesar ? Why should that name be sounded more then yours Write them together : Yours , is as faire a Name : Sound them , it doth become the mouth aswell : Weigh them , it is as heauy : Coniure with ' em , Brutus will start a Spirit as soone as Caesar . Now in the names of all the Gods at once , Vpon what meate doth this our Caesar feede , That he is growne so great ? Age , thou art sham ' d . Rome , thou hast lost the breed of Noble Bloods . When went there by an Age , since the great Flood , But it was fam ' d with more then with one man ? When could they say ( till now ) that talk ' d of Rome , That her wide Walkes incompast but one man ? Now is it Rome indeed , and Roome enough When there is in it but one onely man . O ! you and I , haue heard our Fathers say , There was a Brutus once , that would haue brook ' d Th ' eternall Diuell to keepe his State in Rome , As easily as a King\n",
      "Bru . That you do loue me , I am nothing iealous : What you would worke me too , I haue some ayme : How I haue thought of this , and of these times I shall recount heereafter . For this present , I would not so ( with loue I might intreat you ) Be any further moou ' d : What you haue said , I will consider : what you haue to say I will with patience heare , and finde a time Both meete to heare , and answer such high things . Till then , my Noble Friend , chew vpon this : Brutus had rather be a Villager , Then to repute himselfe a Sonne of Rome Vnder these hard Conditions , as this time Is like to lay vpon vs\n",
      "Cassi . I am glad that my weake words Haue strucke but thus much shew of fire from Brutus , Enter Caesar and his Traine .\n",
      "Bru . The Games are done , And Caesar is returning\n",
      "Cassi . As they passe by , Plucke Caska by the Sleeue , And he will ( after his sowre fashion ) tell you What hath proceeded worthy note to day\n",
      "Bru . I will do so : but looke you Cassius , The angry spot doth glow on Caesars brow , And all the rest , looke like a chidden Traine ; Calphurnia ' s Cheeke is pale , and Cicero Lookes with such Ferret , and such fiery eyes As we haue seene him in the Capitoll Being crost in Conference , by some Senators\n",

      "Ant . Caesar\n",
      "Caes Let me haue men about me , that are fat , Sleeke - headed men , and such as sleepe a - nights : Yond Cassius has a leane and hungry looke , He thinkes too much : such men are dangerous\n",
      "Ant . Feare him not Caesar , he ' s not dangerous , He is a Noble Roman , and well giuen\n",
      "Caes Would he were fatter ; But I feare him not : Yet if my name were lyable to feare , I do not know the man I should auoyd So soone as that spare Cassius . He reades much , He is a great Obseruer , and he lookes Quite through the Deeds of men . He loues no Playes , As thou dost Antony : he heares no Musicke ; Seldome he smiles , and smiles in such a sort As if he mock ' d himselfe , and scorn ' d his spirit That could be mou ' d to smile at any thing . Such men as he , be neuer at hearts ease , Whiles they behold a greater then themselues , And therefore are they very dangerous . I rather tell thee what is to be fear ' d , Then what I feare : for alwayes I am Caesar . Come on my right hand , for this eare is deafe , And tell me truely , what thou think ' st of him .\n",

      "Cask . Why you were with him , were you not ? Bru . I should not then aske Caska what had chanc ' d\n",
      "Cask . Why there was a Crowne offer ' d him ; & being offer ' d him , he put it by with the backe of his hand thus , and then the people fell a shouting\n",
      "Bru . What was the second noyse for ? Cask . Why for that too\n",
      "Cassi . They shouted thrice : what was the last cry for ? Cask . Why for that too\n",
      "Bru . Was the Crowne offer ' d him thrice ? Cask . I marry was ' t , and hee put it by thrice , euerie time gentler then other ; and at euery putting by , mine honest Neighbors showted\n",
      "Cassi . Who offer ' d him the Crowne ? Cask . Why Antony\n",
      "Bru . Tell vs the manner of it , gentle Caska\n",
      "Caska . I can as well bee hang ' d as tell the manner of it : It was meere Foolerie , I did not marke it . I sawe Marke Antony offer him a Crowne , yet ' twas not a Crowne neyther , ' twas one of these Coronets : and as I told you , hee put it by once : but for all that , to my thinking , he would faine haue had it . Then hee offered it to him againe : then hee put it by againe : but to my thinking , he was very loath to lay his fingers off it . And then he offered it the third time ; hee put it the third time by , and still as hee refus ' d it , the rabblement howted , and clapp ' d their chopt hands , and threw vppe their sweatie Night - cappes , and vttered such a deale of stinking breath , because Caesar refus ' d the Crowne , that it had ( almost ) choaked Caesar : for hee swoonded , and fell downe at it : And for mine owne part , I durst not laugh , for feare of opening my Lippes , and receyuing the bad Ayre\n",
      "Cassi . But soft I pray you : what , did Caesar swound ? Cask . He fell downe in the Market - place , and foam ' d at mouth , and was speechlesse\n",
      "Brut . ' Tis very like he hath the Falling sicknesse\n",
      "Cassi . No , Caesar hath it not : but you , and I , And honest Caska , we haue the Falling sicknesse\n",
      "Cask . I know not what you meane by that , but I am sure Caesar fell downe . If the tag - ragge people did not clap him , and hisse him , according as he pleas ' d , and displeas ' d them , as they vse to doe the Players in the Theatre , I am no true man\n",
      "Brut . What said he , when he came vnto himselfe ? Cask . Marry , before he fell downe , when he perceiu ' d the common Heard was glad he refus ' d the Crowne , he pluckt me ope his Doublet , and offer ' d them his Throat to cut : and I had beene a man of any Occupation , if I would not haue taken him at a word , I would I might goe to Hell among the Rogues , and so hee fell . When he came to himselfe againe , hee said , If hee had done , or said any thing amisse , he desir ' d their Worships to thinke it was his infirmitie . Three or foure Wenches where I stood , cryed , Alasse good Soule , and forgaue him with all their hearts : But there ' s no heed to be taken of them ; if Caesar had stab ' d their Mothers , they would haue done no lesse\n",
      "Brut . And after that , he came thus sad away\n",
      "Cask . I\n",
      "Cassi . Did Cicero say any thing ? Cask . I , he spoke Greeke\n",
      "Cassi . To what effect ? Cask . Nay , and I tell you that , Ile ne ' re looke you i ' th ' face againe . But those that vnderstood him , smil ' d at one another , and shooke their heads : but for mine owne part , it was Greeke to me . I could tell you more newes too : Murrellus and Flauius , for pulling Scarffes off Caesars Images , are put to silence . Fare you well . There was more Foolerie yet , if I could remember it\n",
      "Cassi . Will you suppe with me to Night , Caska ? Cask . No , I am promis ' d forth\n",
      "Cassi . Will you Dine with me to morrow ? Cask . I , if I be aliue , and your minde hold , and your Dinner worth the eating\n",
      "Cassi . Good , I will expect you\n",
      "Cask . Doe so : farewell both . Enter .\n",
      "Brut . What a blunt fellow is this growne to be ? He was quick Mettle , when he went to Schoole\n",
      "Cassi . So is he now , in execution Of any bold , or Noble Enterprize , How - euer he puts on this tardie forme : This Rudenesse is a Sawce to his good Wit , Which giues men stomacke to disgest his words With better Appetite\n",
      "Brut . And so it is : For this time I will leaue you : To morrow , if you please to speake with me , I will come home to you : or if you will , Come home to me , and I will wait for you\n",
      "Cassi . I will doe so : till then , thinke of the World . Exit Brutus .\n",
      "Well Brutus , thou art Noble : yet I see , Thy Honorable Mettle may be wrought From that it is dispos ' d : therefore it is meet , That Noble mindes keepe euer with their likes : For who so firme , that cannot be seduc ' d ? Caesar doth beare me hard , but he loues Brutus . If I were Brutus now , and he were Cassius , He should not humor me . I will this Night , In seuerall Hands , in at his Windowes throw , As if they came from seuerall Citizens , Writings , all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his Name : wherein obscurely Caesars Ambition shall be glanced at . And after this , let Caesar seat him sure , For wee will shake him , or worse dayes endure . Enter .\n",
      "Thunder , and Lightning . Enter Caska , and Cicero .\n",
      "Cic . Good euen , Caska : brought you Caesar home ? Why are you breathlesse , and why stare you so ? Cask . Are not you mou ' d , when all the sway of Earth Shakes , like a thing vnfirme ? O Cicero , I haue seene Tempests , when the scolding Winds Haue riu ' d the knottie Oakes , and I haue seene Th ' ambitious Ocean swell , and rage , and foame , To be exalted with the threatning Clouds : But neuer till to Night , neuer till now , Did I goe through a Tempest - dropping - fire . Eyther there is a Ciuill strife in Heauen , Or else the World , too sawcie with the Gods , Incenses them to send destruction\n",
      "Cic . Why , saw you any thing more wonderfull ? Cask . A common slaue , you know him well by sight , Held vp his left Hand , which did flame and burne Like twentie Torches ioyn ' d ; and yet his Hand , Not sensible of fire , remain ' d vnscorch ' d . Besides , I ha ' not since put vp my Sword , Against the Capitoll I met a Lyon , Who glaz ' d vpon me , and went surly by , Without annoying me . And there were drawne Vpon a heape , a hundred gastly Women , Transformed with their feare , who swore , they saw Men , all in fire , walke vp and downe the streetes . And yesterday , the Bird of Night did sit , Euen at Noone - day , vpon the Market place , Howting , and shreeking . When these Prodigies Doe so conioyntly meet , let not men say , These are their Reasons , they are Naturall : For I beleeue , they are portentous things Vnto the Clymate , that they point vpon\n",
      "Cic . Indeed , it is a strange disposed time : But men may construe things after their fashion , Cleane from the purpose of the things themselues . Comes Caesar to the Capitoll to morrow ? Cask . He doth : for he did bid Antonio Send word to you , he would be there to morrow\n",
      "Cic . Good - night then , Caska : This disturbed Skie is not to walke in\n",
      "Cask . Farewell Cicero .\n",
      "Exit Cicero .\n",
      "Enter Cassius .\n",
      "Cassi . Who ' s there ? Cask . A Romane\n",
      "Cassi . Caska , by your Voyce\n",
      "Cask . Your Eare is good . Cassius , what Night is this ? Cassi . A very pleasing Night to honest men\n",
      "Cask . Who euer knew the Heauens menace so ? Cassi . Those that haue knowne the Earth so full of faults . For my part , I haue walk ' d about the streets , Submitting me vnto the perillous Night ; And thus vnbraced , Caska , as you see , Haue bar ' d my Bosome to the Thunder - stone : And when the crosse blew Lightning seem ' d to open The Brest of Heauen , I did present my selfe Euen in the ayme , and very flash of it\n",
      "Cask . But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heauens ? It is the part of men , to feare and tremble , When the most mightie Gods , by tokens send Such dreadfull Heraulds , to astonish vs\n",
      "Cassi . You are dull , Caska : And those sparkes of Life , that should be in a Roman , You doe want , or else you vse not . You looke pale , and gaze , and put on feare , And cast your selfe in wonder , To see the strange impatience of the Heauens : But if you would consider the true cause , Why all these Fires , why all these gliding Ghosts , Why Birds and Beasts , from qualitie and kinde , Why Old men , Fooles , and Children calculate , Why all these things change from their Ordinance , Their Natures , and pre - formed Faculties , To monstrous qualitie ; why you shall finde , That Heauen hath infus ' d them with these Spirits , To make them Instruments of feare , and warning , Vnto some monstrous State . Now could I ( Caska ) name to thee a man , Most like this dreadfull Night , That Thunders , Lightens , opens Graues , and roares , As doth the Lyon in the Capitoll : A man no mightier then thy selfe , or me , In personall action ; yet prodigious growne , And fearefull , as these strange eruptions are\n",
      "Cask . ' Tis Caesar that you meane : Is it not , Cassius ? Cassi . Let it be who it is : for Romans now Haue Thewes , and Limbes , like to their Ancestors ; But woe the while , our Fathers mindes are dead , And we are gouern ' d with our Mothers spirits , Our yoake , and sufferance , shew vs Womanish\n",
      "Cask . Indeed , they say , the Senators to morrow Meane to establish Caesar as a King : And he shall weare his Crowne by Sea , and Land , In euery place , saue here in Italy\n",
      "Cassi . I know where I will weare this Dagger then ; Cassius from Bondage will deliuer Cassius : Therein , yee Gods , you make the weake most strong ; Therein , yee Gods , you Tyrants doe defeat . Nor Stonie Tower , nor Walls of beaten Brasse , Nor ayre - lesse Dungeon , nor strong Linkes of Iron , Can be retentiue to the strength of spirit : But Life being wearie of these worldly Barres , Neuer lacks power to dismisse it selfe . If I know this , know all the World besides , That part of Tyrannie that I doe beare , I can shake off at pleasure .\n",
      "Thunder still .\n",
      "Cask . So can I : So euery Bond - man in his owne hand beares The power to cancell his Captiuitie\n",
      "Cassi . And why should CÃ¦sar be a Tyrant then ? Poore man , I know he would not be a Wolfe , But that he sees the Romans are but Sheepe : He were no Lyon , were not Romans Hindes . Those that with haste will make a mightie fire , Begin it with weake Strawes . What trash is Rome ? What Rubbish , and what Offall ? when it serues For the base matter , to illuminate So vile a thing as Caesar . But oh Griefe , Where hast thou led me ? I ( perhaps ) speake this Before a willing Bond - man : then I know My answere must be made . But I am arm ' d , And dangers are to me indifferent\n",
      "Cask . You speake to Caska , and to such a man , That is no flearing Tell - tale . Hold , my Hand : Be factious for redresse of all these Griefes , And I will set this foot of mine as farre , As who goes farthest\n",
      "Cassi . There ' s a Bargaine made . Now know you , Caska , I haue mou ' d already Some certaine of the Noblest minded Romans To vnder - goe , with me , an Enterprize , Of Honorable dangerous consequence ; And I doe know by this , they stay for me In Pompeyes Porch : for now this fearefull Night , There is no stirre , or walking in the streetes ; And the Complexion of the Element Is Fauors , like the Worke we haue in hand , Most bloodie , fierie , and most terrible . Enter Cinna .\n",
      "Caska . Stand close a while , for heere comes one in haste\n",
      "Cassi . ' Tis Cinna , I doe know him by his Gate , He is a friend . Cinna , where haste you so ? Cinna . To finde out you : Who ' s that , Metellus Cymber ? Cassi . No , it is Caska , one incorporate To our Attempts . Am I not stay ' d for , Cinna ? Cinna . I am glad on ' t . What a fearefull Night is this ? There ' s two or three of vs haue seene strange sights\n",
      "Cassi . Am I not stay ' d for ? tell me\n",
      "Cinna . Yes , you are . O Cassius , If you could but winne the Noble Brutus To our party - Cassi . Be you content . Good Cinna , take this Paper , And looke you lay it in the Pretors Chayre , Where Brutus may but finde it : and throw this In at his Window ; set this vp with Waxe Vpon old Brutus Statue : all this done , Repaire to Pompeyes Porch , where you shall finde vs . Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there ? Cinna . All , but Metellus Cymber , and hee ' s gone To seeke you at your house . Well , I will hie , And so bestow these Papers as you bad me\n",
      "Cassi . That done , repayre to Pompeyes Theater .\n",
      "Exit Cinna .\n",
      "Come Caska , you and I will yet , ere day , See Brutus at his house : three parts of him Is ours alreadie , and the man entire Vpon the next encounter , yeelds him ours\n",
      "Cask . O , he sits high in all the Peoples hearts : And that which would appeare Offence in vs , His Countenance , like richest Alchymie , Will change to Vertue , and to Worthinesse\n",
      "Cassi . Him , and his worth , and our great need of him , You haue right well conceited : let vs goe , For it is after Mid - night , and ere day , We will awake him , and be sure of him .\n",

      "Luc . Call ' d you , my Lord ? Brut . Get me a Tapor in my Study , Lucius : When it is lighted , come and call me here\n",
      "Luc . I will , my Lord . Enter .\n",
      "Brut . It must be by his death : and for my part , I know no personall cause , to spurne at him , But for the generall . He would be crown ' d : How that might change his nature , there ' s the question ? It is the bright day , that brings forth the Adder , And that craues warie walking : Crowne him that , And then I graunt we put a Sting in him , That at his will he may doe danger with . Th ' abuse of Greatnesse , is , when it dis - ioynes Remorse from Power : And to speake truth of Caesar , I haue not knowne , when his Affections sway ' d More then his Reason . But ' tis a common proofe , That Lowlynesse is young Ambitions Ladder , Whereto the Climber vpward turnes his Face : But when he once attaines the vpmost Round , He then vnto the Ladder turnes his Backe , Lookes in the Clouds , scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend : so Caesar may ; Then least he may , preuent . And since the Quarrell Will beare no colour , for the thing he is , Fashion it thus ; that what he is , augmented , Would runne to these , and these extremities : And therefore thinke him as a Serpents egge , Which hatch ' d , would as his kinde grow mischieuous ; And kill him in the shell . Enter Lucius .\n",

Such instigations haue beene often dropt , Where I haue tooke them vp : Shall Rome , & c . Thus must I piece it out : Shall Rome stand vnder one mans awe ? What Rome ? My Ancestors did from the streetes of Rome The Tarquin driue , when he was call ' d a King . Speake , strike , redresse . Am I entreated To speake , and strike ? O Rome , I make thee promise , If the redresse will follow , thou receiuest Thy full Petition at the hand of Brutus . Enter Lucius .\n",

      "Brut . ' Tis good . Go to the Gate , some body knocks : Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar , I haue not slept . Betweene the acting of a dreadfull thing , And the first motion , all the Interim is Like a Phantasma , or a hideous Dreame : The Genius , and the mortall Instruments Are then in councell ; and the state of a man , Like to a little Kingdome , suffers then The nature of an Insurrection . Enter Lucius .\n",

O then , by day Where wilt thou finde a Cauerne darke enough , To maske thy monstrous Visage ? Seek none Conspiracie , Hide it in Smiles , and Affabilitie : For if thou path thy natiue semblance on , Not Erebus it selfe were dimme enough , To hide thee from preuention .

      "Cass . I thinke we are too bold vpon your Rest : Good morrow Brutus , doe we trouble you ? Brut . I haue beene vp this howre , awake all Night : Know I these men , that come along with you ? Cass . Yes , euery man of them ; and no man here But honors you : and euery one doth wish , You had but that opinion of your selfe , Which euery Noble Roman beares of you . This is Trebonius\n",

      "Cask . You shall confesse , that you are both deceiu ' d : Heere , as I point my Sword , the Sunne arises , Which is a great way growing on the South , Weighing the youthfull Season of the yeare . Some two moneths hence , vp higher toward the North He first presents his fire , and the high East Stands as the Capitoll , directly heere\n",

      "Brut . No , not an Oath : if not the Face of men , The sufferance of our Soules , the times Abuse ; If these be Motiues weake , breake off betimes , And euery man hence , to his idle bed : So let high - sighted - Tyranny range on , Till each man drop by Lottery . But if these ( As I am sure they do ) beare fire enough To kindle Cowards , and to steele with valour The melting Spirits of women . Then Countrymen , What neede we any spurre , but our owne cause To pricke vs to redresse ? What other Bond , Then secret Romans , that haue spoke the word , And will not palter ? And what other Oath , Then Honesty to Honesty ingag ' d , That this shall be , or we will fall for it . Sweare Priests and Cowards , and men Cautelous Old feeble Carrions , and such suffering Soules That welcome wrongs : Vnto bad causes , sweare Such Creatures as men doubt ; but do not staine The euen vertue of our Enterprize , Nor th ' insuppressiue Mettle of our Spirits , To thinke , that or our Cause , or our Performance Did neede an Oath .

      "Cyn . No , by no meanes\n",
      "Metel . O let vs haue him , for his Siluer haires Will purchase vs a good opinion : And buy mens voyces , to commend our deeds : It shall be sayd , his iudgement rul ' d our hands , Our youths , and wildenesse , shall no whit appeare , But all be buried in his Grauity\n",
      "Bru . O name him not ; let vs not breake with him , For he will neuer follow any thing That other men begin\n",

      "Cask . Indeed , he is not fit\n",
      "Decius . Shall no man else be toucht , but onely Caesar ? Cas . Decius well vrg ' d : I thinke it is not meet , Marke Antony , so well belou ' d of Caesar , Should out - liue Caesar , we shall finde of him A shrew ' d Contriuer . And you know , his meanes If he improue them , may well stretch so farre As to annoy vs all : which to preuent , Let Antony and Caesar fall together\n",
      "Bru . Our course will seeme too bloody , Caius Cassius , To cut the Head off , and then hacke the Limbes : Like Wrath in death , and Enuy afterwards : For Antony , is but a Limbe of Caesar . Let ' s be Sacrificers , but not Butchers Caius : We all stand vp against the spirit of Caesar , And in the Spirit of men , there is no blood : O that we then could come by Caesars Spirit , And not dismember Caesar ! But ( alas ) Caesar must bleed for it . And gentle Friends , Let ' s kill him Boldly , but not Wrathfully : Let ' s carue him , as a Dish fit for the Gods , Not hew him as a Carkasse fit for Hounds : And let our Hearts , as subtle Masters do , Stirre vp their Seruants to an acte of Rage , And after seeme to chide ' em . This shall make Our purpose Necessary , and not Enuious . Which so appearing to the common eyes , We shall be call ' d Purgers , not Murderers . And for Marke Antony , thinke not of him : For he can do no more then Caesars Arme , When Caesars head is off\n",
      "Cas . Yet I feare him , For in the ingrafted loue he beares to Caesar\n",
      "Bru . Alas , good Cassius , do not thinke of him : If he loue Caesar , all that he can do Is to himselfe ; take thought , and dye for Caesar , And that were much he should : for he is giuen To sports , to wildenesse , and much company\n",

      "Treb . ' Tis time to part\n",
      "Cass . But it is doubtfull yet , Whether Caesar will come forth to day , or no : For he is Superstitious growne of late , Quite from the maine Opinion he held once , Of Fantasie , of Dreames , and Ceremonies : It may be , these apparant Prodigies , The vnaccustom ' d Terror of this night , And the perswasion of his Augurers , May hold him from the Capitoll to day\n",
      "Decius . Neuer feare that : If he be so resolu ' d , I can ore - sway him : For he loues to heare , That Vnicornes may be betray ' d with Trees , And Beares with Glasses , Elephants with Holes , Lyons with Toyles , and men with Flatterers . But , when I tell him , he hates Flatterers , He sayes , he does ; being then most flattered . Let me worke : For I can giue his humour the true bent ; And I will bring him to the Capitoll\n",

I vrg ' d you further , then you scratch ' d your head , And too impatiently stampt with your foote : Yet I insisted , yet you answer ' d not , But with an angry wafter of your hand Gaue signe for me to leaue you : So I did , Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seem ' d too much inkindled ; and withall , Hoping it was but an effect of Humor , Which sometime hath his houre with euery man . It will not let you eate , nor talke , nor sleepe ; And could it worke so much vpon your shape , As it hath much preuayl ' d on your Condition , I should not know you Brutus .

No my Brutus , You haue some sicke Offence within your minde , Which by the Right and Vertue of my place I ought to know of : And vpon my knees , I charme you , by my once commended Beauty , By all your vowes of Loue , and that great Vow Which did incorporate and make vs one , That you vnfold to me , your selfe ; your halfe Why you are heauy : and what men to night Haue had resort to you : for heere haue beene Some sixe or seuen , who did hide their faces Euen from darknesse\n",

But heere ' s a Parchment , with the Seale of Caesar , I found it in his Closset , ' tis his Will : Let but the Commons heare this Testament : ( Which pardon me ) I do not meane to reade , And they would go and kisse dead Caesars wounds , And dip their Napkins in his Sacred Blood ; Yea , begge a haire of him for Memory , And dying , mention it within their Willes , Bequeathing it as a rich Legacie Vnto their issue\n",

Slanders Sir : for the Satyricall slaue saies here , that old men haue gray Beards ; that their faces are wrinkled ; their eyes purging thicke Amber , or Plum - Tree Gumme : and that they haue a plentifull locke of Wit , together with weake Hammes . All which Sir , though I most powerfully , and potently beleeue ; yet I holde it not Honestie to haue it thus set downe : For you your selfe Sir , should be old as I am , if like a Crab you could go backward\n",
      "Pol . Though this be madnesse , Yet there is Method in ' t : will you walke Out of the ayre my Lord ? Ham . Into my Graue ? Pol . Indeed that is out o ' th ' Ayre : How pregnant ( sometimes ) his Replies are ? A happinesse , That often Madnesse hits on , Which Reason and Sanitie could not So prosperously be deliuer ' d of . I will leaue him , And sodainely contriue the meanes of meeting Betweene him , and my daughter . My Honourable Lord , I will most humbly Take my leaue of you\n",

      "Ham . In the secret parts of Fortune ? Oh , most true : she is a Strumpet . What ' s the newes ? Rosin . None my Lord ; but that the World ' s growne honest\n",
      "Ham . Then is Doomesday neere : But your newes is not true . Let me question more in particular : what haue you my good friends , deserued at the hands of Fortune , that she sends you to Prison hither ? Guil . Prison , my Lord ? Ham . Denmark ' s a Prison\n",
      "Rosin . Then is the World one\n",
      "Ham . A goodly one , in which there are many Confines , Wards , and Dungeons ; Denmarke being one o ' th ' worst\n",
      "Rosin . We thinke not so my Lord\n",
      "Ham . Why then ' tis none to you ; for there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so : to me it is a prison\n",
      "Rosin . Why then your Ambition makes it one : ' tis too narrow for your minde\n",
      "Ham . O God , I could be bounded in a nutshell , and count my selfe a King of infinite space ; were it not that I haue bad dreames\n",
      "Guil . Which dreames indeed are Ambition : for the very substance of the Ambitious , is meerely the shadow of a Dreame\n",
      "Ham . A dreame it selfe is but a shadow\n",
      "Rosin . Truely , and I hold Ambition of so ayry and light a quality , that it is but a shadowes shadow\n",
      "Ham . Then are our Beggers bodies ; and our Monarchs and out - stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes : shall wee to th ' Court : for , by my fey I cannot reason ? Both . Wee ' l wait vpon you\n",
      "Ham . No such matter . I will not sort you with the rest of my seruants : for to speake to you like an honest man : I am most dreadfully attended ; but in the beaten way of friendship , What make you at Elsonower ? Rosin . To visit you my Lord , no other occasion\n",
      "Ham . Begger that I am , I am euen poore in thankes ; but I thanke you : and sure deare friends my thanks are too deare a halfepeny ; were you not sent for ? Is it your owne inclining ? Is it a free visitation ? Come , deale iustly with me : come , come ; nay speake\n",
      "Guil . What should we say my Lord ? Ham . Why any thing . But to the purpose ; you were sent for ; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes ; which your modesties haue not craft enough to color , I know the good King & Queene haue sent for you\n",
      "Rosin . To what end my Lord ? Ham . That you must teach me : but let mee coniure you by the rights of our fellowship , by the consonancy of our youth , by the Obligation of our euer - preserued loue , and by what more deare , a better proposer could charge you withall ; be euen and direct with me , whether you were sent for or no\n",
      "Rosin . What say you ? Ham . Nay then I haue an eye of you : if you loue me hold not off\n",
      "Guil . My Lord , we were sent for\n",
      "Ham . I will tell you why ; so shall my anticipation preuent your discouery of your secricie to the King and Queene : moult no feather , I haue of late , but wherefore I know not , lost all my mirth , forgone all custome of exercise ; and indeed , it goes so heauenly with my disposition ; that this goodly frame the Earth , seemes to me a sterrill Promontory ; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre , look you , this braue ore - hanging , this Maiesticall Roofe , fretted with golden fire : why , it appeares no other thing to mee , then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours . What a piece of worke is a man ! how Noble in Reason ? how infinite in faculty ? in forme and mouing how expresse and admirable ? in Action , how like an Angel ? in apprehension , how like a God ? the beauty of the world , the Parragon of Animals ; and yet to me , what is this Quintessence of Dust ? Man delights not me ; no , nor Woman neither ; though by your smiling you seeme to say so\n",
      "Rosin . My Lord , there was no such stuffe in my thoughts\n",
      "Ham . Why did you laugh , when I said , Man delights not me ? Rosin . To thinke , my Lord , if you delight not in Man , what Lenton entertainment the Players shall receiue from you : wee coated them on the way , and hither are they comming to offer you Seruice\n",
      "Ham . He that playes the King shall be welcome ; his Maiesty shall haue Tribute of mee : the aduenturous Knight shal vse his Foyle and Target : the Louer shall not sigh gratis , the humorous man shall end his part in peace : the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled a ' th ' sere : and the Lady shall say her minde freely ; or the blanke Verse shall halt for ' t : what Players are they ? Rosin . Euen those you were wont to take delight in the Tragedians of the City\n",
      "Ham . How chances it they trauaile ? their residence both in reputation and profit was better both wayes\n",
      "Rosin . I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanes of the late Innouation ? Ham . Doe they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the City ? Are they so follow ' d ? Rosin . No indeed , they are not\n",
      "Ham . How comes it ? doe they grow rusty ? Rosin . Nay , their indeauour keepes in the wonted pace ; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children , little Yases , that crye out on the top of question ; and are most tyrannically clap ' t for ' t : these are now the fashion , and so be - ratled the common Stages ( so they call them ) that many wearing Rapiers , are affraide of Goose - quils , and dare scarse come thither\n",
      "Ham . What are they Children ? Who maintains ' em ? How are they escorted ? Will they pursue the Quality no longer then they can sing ? Will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselues to common Players ( as it is most like if their meanes are not better ) their Writers do them wrong , to make them exclaim against their owne Succession\n",
      "Rosin . Faith there ha ' s bene much to do on both sides : and the Nation holds it no sinne , to tarre them to Controuersie . There was for a while , no mony bid for argument , vnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes in the Question\n",
      "Ham . Is ' t possible ? Guild . Oh there ha ' s beene much throwing about of Braines\n",
      "Ham . Do the Boyes carry it away ? Rosin . I that they do my Lord . Hercules & his load too\n",
      "Ham . It is not strange : for mine Vnckle is King of Denmarke , and those that would make mowes at him while my Father liued ; giue twenty , forty , an hundred Ducates a peece , for his picture in Little . There is something in this more then Naturall , if Philosophie could finde it out .\n",

Let me comply with you in the Garbe , lest my extent to the Players ( which I tell you must shew fairely outward ) should more appeare like entertainment then yours . You are welcome : but my Vnckle Father , and Aunt Mother are deceiu ' d\n",

      "1 . Play . What speech , my Lord ? Ham . I heard thee speak me a speech once , but it was neuer Acted : or if it was , not aboue once , for the Play I remember pleas ' d not the Million , ' twas Cauiarie to the Generall : but it was ( as I receiu ' d it , and others , whose iudgement in such matters , cried in the top of mine ) an excellent Play ; well digested in the Scoenes , set downe with as much modestie , as cunning . I remember one said , there was no Sallets in the lines , to make the matter sauory ; nor no matter in the phrase , that might indite the Author of affectation , but cal ' d it an honest method . One cheefe Speech in it , I cheefely lou ' d , ' twas Aeneas Tale to Dido , and thereabout of it especially , where he speaks of Priams slaughter . If it liue in your memory , begin at this Line , let me see , let me see : The rugged Pyrrhus like th ' Hyrcanian Beast . It is not so : it begins with Pyrrhus The rugged Pyrrhus , he whose Sable Armes Blacke as his purpose , did the night resemble When he lay couched in the Ominous Horse , Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear ' d With Heraldry more dismall : Head to foote Now is he to take Geulles , horridly Trick ' d With blood of Fathers , Mothers , Daughters , Sonnes , Bak ' d and impasted with the parching streets , That lend a tyrannous , and damned light To their vilde Murthers , roasted in wrath and fire , And thus o ' re - sized with coagulate gore , With eyes like Carbuncles , the hellish Pyrrhus Olde Grandsire Priam seekes\n",

His anticke Sword , Rebellious to his Arme , lyes where it falles Repugnant to command : vnequall match , Pyrrhus at Priam driues , in Rage strikes wide : But with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword , Th ' vnnerued Father fals . Then senselesse Illium , Seeming to feele his blow , with flaming top Stoopes to his Bace , and with a hideous crash Takes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare . For loe , his Sword Which was declining on the Milkie head Of Reuerend Priam , seem ' d i ' th ' Ayre to sticke : So as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus stood , And like a Newtrall to his will and matter , did nothing . But as we often see against some storme , A silence in the Heauens , the Racke stand still , The bold windes speechlesse , and the Orbe below As hush as death : Anon the dreadfull Thunder Doth rend the Region . So after Pyrrhus pause , A rowsed Vengeance sets him new a - worke , And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall On Mars his Armours , forg ' d for proofe Eterne , With lesse remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding sword Now falles on Priam . Out , out , thou Strumpet - Fortune , all you Gods , In generall Synod take away her power : Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele , And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen , As low as to the Fiends\n",

Run bare - foot vp and downe , Threatning the flame With Bisson Rheume : A clout about that head , Where late the Diadem stood , and for a Robe About her lanke and all ore - teamed Loines , A blanket in th ' Alarum of feare caught vp . Who this had seene , with tongue in Venome steep ' d , ' Gainst Fortunes State , would Treason haue pronounc ' d ? But if the Gods themselues did see her then , When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes , The instant Burst of Clamour that she made ( Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all ) Would haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen , And passion in the Gods\n",

Is it not monstrous that this Player heere , But in a Fixion , in a dreame of Passion , Could force his soule so to his whole conceit , That from her working , all his visage warm ' d ; Teares in his eyes , distraction in ' s Aspect , A broken voyce , and his whole Function suiting With Formes , to his Conceit ? And all for nothing ? For Hecuba ? What ' s Hecuba to him , or he to Hecuba , That he should weepe for her ? What would he doe , Had he the Motiue and the Cue for passion That I haue ? He would drowne the Stage with teares , And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech : Make mad the guilty , and apale the free , Confound the ignorant , and amaze indeed , The very faculty of Eyes and Eares . Yet I , A dull and muddy - metled Rascall , peake Like Iohn a - dreames , vnpregnant of my cause , And can say nothing : No , not for a King , Vpon whose property , and most deere life , A damn ' d defeate was made . Am I a Coward ? Who calles me Villaine ? breakes my pate a - crosse ? Pluckes off my Beard , and blowes it in my face ? Tweakes me by ' th ' Nose ? giues me the Lye i ' th ' Throate , As deepe as to the Lungs ? Who does me this ? Ha ? Why I should take it : for it cannot be , But I am Pigeon - Liuer ' d , and lacke Gall To make Oppression bitter , or ere this , I should haue fatted all the Region Kites With this Slaues Offall , bloudy : a Bawdy villaine , Remorselesse , Treacherous , Letcherous , kindles villaine ! Oh Vengeance ! Who ? What an Asse am I ? I sure , this is most braue , That I , the Sonne of the Deere murthered , Prompted to my Reuenge by Heauen , and Hell , Must ( like a Whore ) vnpacke my heart with words , And fall a Cursing like a very Drab . A Scullion ? Fye vpon ' t : Foh . About my Braine . I haue heard , that guilty Creatures sitting at a Play , Haue by the very cunning of the Scoene , Bene strooke so to the soule , that presently They haue proclaim ' d their Malefactions . For Murther , though it haue no tongue , will speake With most myraculous Organ . Ile haue these Players , Play something like the murder of my Father , Before mine Vnkle . Ile obserue his lookes , Ile rent him to the quicke : If he but blench I know my course . The Spirit that I haue seene May be the Diuell , and the Diuel hath power T ' assume a pleasing shape , yea and perhaps Out of my Weaknesse , and my Melancholly , As he is very potent with such Spirits , Abuses me to damne me .

      "Ham . To be , or not to be , that is the Question : Whether ' tis Nobler in the minde to suffer The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune , Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles , And by opposing end them : to dye , to sleepe No more ; and by a sleepe , to say we end The Heart - ake , and the thousand Naturall shockes That Flesh is heyre too ? ' Tis a consummation Deuoutly to be wish ' d . To dye to sleepe , To sleepe , perchance to Dreame ; I , there ' s the rub , For in that sleepe of death , what dreames may come , When we haue shuffel ' d off this mortall coile , Must giue vs pawse . There ' s the respect That makes Calamity of so long life : For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time , The Oppressors wrong , the poore mans Contumely , The pangs of dispriz ' d Loue , the Lawes delay , The insolence of Office , and the Spurnes That patient merit of the vnworthy takes , When he himselfe might his Quietus make With a bare Bodkin ? Who would these Fardles beare To grunt and sweat vnder a weary life , But that the dread of something after death , The vndiscouered Countrey , from whose Borne No Traueller returnes , Puzels the will , And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue , Then flye to others that we know not of . Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all , And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution Is sicklied o ' re , with the pale cast of Thought , And enterprizes of great pith and moment , With this regard their Currants turne away , And loose the name of Action .

Most necessary ' tis , that we forget To pay our selues , what to our selues is debt : What to our selues in passion we propose , The passion ending , doth the purpose lose . The violence of other Greefe or Ioy , Their owne ennactors with themselues destroy : Where Ioy most Reuels , Greefe doth most lament ; Greefe ioyes , Ioy greeues on slender accident . This world is not for aye , nor ' tis not strange That euen our Loues should with our Fortunes change . For ' tis a question left vs yet to proue , Whether Loue lead Fortune , or else Fortune Loue . The great man downe , you marke his fauourites flies , The poore aduanc ' d , makes Friends of Enemies : And hitherto doth Loue on Fortune tend , For who not needs , shall neuer lacke a Frend : And who in want a hollow Friend doth try , Directly seasons him his Enemie . But orderly to end , where I begun , Our Willes and Fates do so contrary run , That our Deuices still are ouerthrowne , Our thoughts are ours , their ends none of our owne .

      "Horatio , When thou shalt haue ouerlook ' d this , giue these Fellowes some meanes to the King : They haue Letters for him . Ere we were two dayes old at Sea , a Pyrate of very Warlicke appointment gaue vs Chace . Finding our selues too slow of Saile , we put on a compelled Valour . In the Grapple , I boorded them : On the instant they got cleare of our Shippe , so I alone became their Prisoner . They haue dealt with mee , like Theeues of Mercy , but they knew what they did . I am to doe a good turne for them . Let the King haue the Letters I haue sent , and repaire thou to me with as much hast as thou wouldest flye death . I haue words to speake in your eare , will make thee dumbe , yet are they much too light for the bore of the Matter . These good Fellowes will bring thee where I am . Rosincrance and Guildensterne , hold their course for England . Of them I haue much to tell thee , Farewell . He that thou knowest thine , Hamlet . Come , I will giue you way for these your Letters , And do ' t the speedier , that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them . Enter .\n",

But tell me , Why you proceeded not against these feates , So crimefull , and so Capitall in Nature , As by your Safety , Wisedome , all things else , You mainly were stirr ' d vp ? King .

The Queen his Mother , Liues almost by his lookes : and for my selfe , My Vertue or my Plague , be it either which , She ' s so coniunctiue to my life , and soule ; That as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere , I could not but by her . The other Motiue , Why to a publike count I might not go , Is the great loue the generall gender beare him , Who dipping all his Faults in their affection , Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone , Conuert his Gyues to Graces . So that my Arrowes Too slightly timbred for so loud a Winde , Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe , And not where I had arm ' d them\n",

If it be now , ' tis not to come : if it bee not to come , it will bee now : if it be not now ; yet it will come ; the readinesse is all , since no man ha ' s ought of what he leaues .

What I haue done That might your nature honour , and exception Roughly awake , I heere proclaime was madnesse : Was ' t Hamlet wrong ' d Laertes ? Neuer Hamlet .

And that is the theme of War , the fortune of battles , The making of perfect soldiers .\n",

      "Here are our thoughts , voyagers ' thoughts , Here not the land , firm land , alone appears , may then by them be said , The sky o ' erarches here , we feel the undulating deck beneath our feet , We feel the long pulsation , ebb and flow of endless motion , The tones of unseen mystery , the vague and vast suggestions of the briny world , the liquid - flowing syllables , The perfume , the faint creaking of the cordage , the melancholy rhythm , The boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here , And this is ocean ' s poem .\n",
      "Then falter not O book , fulfil your destiny , You not a reminiscence of the land alone , You too as a lone bark cleaving the ether , purpos ' d I know not whither , yet ever full of faith , Consort to every ship that sails , sail you ! Bear forth to them folded my love , ( dear mariners , for you I fold it here in every leaf ;) Speed on my book ! spread your white sails my little bark athwart the imperious waves , Chant on , sail on , bear o ' er the boundless blue from me to every sea , This song for mariners and all their ships .\n",

Scaling mountains , pulling myself cautiously up , holding on by low scragged limbs , Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush , Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat - lot , Where the bat flies in the Seventh - month eve , where the great goldbug drops through the dark , Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow , Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides , Where the cheese - cloth hangs in the kitchen , where andirons straddle the hearth - slab , where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters ; Where trip - hammers crash , where the press is whirling its cylinders , Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs , Where the pear - shaped balloon is floating aloft , ( floating in it myself and looking composedly down ,) Where the life - car is drawn on the slip - noose , where the heat hatches pale - green eggs in the dented sand , Where the she - whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it , Where the steam - ship trails hind - ways its long pennant of smoke , Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water , Where the half - burn ' d brig is riding on unknown currents , Where shells grow to her slimy deck , where the dead are corrupting below ; Where the dense - starr ' d flag is borne at the head of the regiments , Approaching Manhattan up by the long - stretching island , Under Niagara , the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance , Upon a door - step , upon the horse - block of hard wood outside , Upon the race - course , or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of base - ball , At he - festivals , with blackguard gibes , ironical license , bull - dances , drinking , laughter , At the cider - mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash , sucking the juice through a straw , At apple - peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find , At musters , beach - parties , friendly bees , huskings , house - raisings ;

Looking in at the shop - windows of Broadway the whole forenoon , flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass , Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn ' d up to the clouds , or down a lane or along the beach , My right and left arms round the sides of two friends , and I in the middle ; Coming home with the silent and dark - cheek ' d bush - boy , ( behind me he rides at the drape of the day ,) Far from the settlements studying the print of animals ' feet , or the moccasin print , By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient , Nigh the coffin ' d corpse when all is still , examining with a candle ; Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure , Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any , Hot toward one I hate , ready in my madness to knife him , Solitary at midnight in my back yard , my thoughts gone from me a long while , Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side , Speeding through space , speeding through heaven and the stars , Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring , and the diameter of eighty thousand miles , Speeding with tail ' d meteors , throwing fire - balls like the rest , Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly , Storming , enjoying , planning , loving , cautioning , Backing and filling , appearing and disappearing , I tread day and night such roads .\n",

O blossoms of my blood ! I permit you to tell in your own way of the heart that is under you , O I do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves , you are not happiness , You are often more bitter than I can bear , you burn and sting me , Yet you are beautiful to me you faint tinged roots , you make me think of death , Death is beautiful from you , ( what indeed is finally beautiful except death and love ?) O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my chant of lovers , I think it must be for death , For how calm , how solemn it grows to ascend to the atmosphere of lovers , Death or life I am then indifferent , my soul declines to prefer , ( I am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most ,) Indeed O death , I think now these leaves mean precisely the same as you mean , Grow up taller sweet leaves that I may see ! grow up out of my breast ! Spring away from the conceal ' d heart there ! Do not fold yourself so in your pink - tinged roots timid leaves ! Do not remain down there so ashamed , herbage of my breast ! Come I am determin ' d to unbare this broad breast of mine , I have long enough stifled and choked ; Emblematic and capricious blades I leave you , now you serve me not , I will say what I have to say by itself , I will sound myself and comrades only , I will never again utter a call only their call , I will raise with it immortal reverberations through the States , I will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and will through the States , Through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating , Give me your tone therefore O death , that I may accord with it , Give me yourself , for I see that you belong to me now above all , and are folded inseparably together , you love and death are , Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I was calling life , For now it is convey ' d to me that you are the purports essential , That you hide in these shifting forms of life , for reasons , and that they are mainly for you , That you beyond them come forth to remain , the real reality , That behind the mask of materials you patiently wait , no matter how long , That you will one day perhaps take control of all , That you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance , That may - be you are what it is all for , but it does not last so very long , But you will last very long .\n",

      "2 The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day , The simple , compact , well - join ' d scheme , myself disintegrated , every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme , The similitudes of the past and those of the future , The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings , on the walk in the street and the passage over the river , The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away , The others that are to follow me , the ties between me and them , The certainty of others , the life , love , sight , hearing of others .\n",
      "Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore , Others will watch the run of the flood - tide , Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west , and the heights of Brooklyn to the south and east , Others will see the islands large and small ; Fifty years hence , others will see them as they cross , the sun half an hour high , A hundred years hence , or ever so many hundred years hence , others will see them , Will enjoy the sunset , the pouring - in of the flood - tide , the falling - back to the sea of the ebb - tide .\n",

      "I too many and many a time cross ' d the river of old , Watched the Twelfth - month sea - gulls , saw them high in the air floating with motionless wings , oscillating their bodies , Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow , Saw the slow - wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south , Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water , Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams , Look ' d at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit water , Look ' d on the haze on the hills southward and south - westward , Look ' d on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet , Look ' d toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving , Saw their approach , saw aboard those that were near me , Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops , saw the ships at anchor , The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars , The round masts , the swinging motion of the hulls , the slender serpentine pennants , The large and small steamers in motion , the pilots in their pilothouses , The white wake left by the passage , the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels , The flags of all nations , the falling of them at sunset , The scallop - edged waves in the twilight , the ladled cups , the frolic - some crests and glistening , The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer , the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the docks , On the river the shadowy group , the big steam - tug closely flank ' d on each side by the barges , the hay - boat , the belated lighter , On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night , Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses , and down into the clefts of streets .\n",
      "4 These and all else were to me the same as they are to you , I loved well those cities , loved well the stately and rapid river , The men and women I saw were all near to me , Others the same -- others who look back on me because I look ' d forward to them , ( The time will come , though I stop here to - day and to - night .)\n",
      "5 What is it then between us ? What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us ?\n",
      "Whatever it is , it avails not -- distance avails not , and place avails not , I too lived , Brooklyn of ample hills was mine , I too walk ' d the streets of Manhattan island , and bathed in the waters around it , I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me , In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me , In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me , I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution , I too had receiv ' d identity by my body , That I was I knew was of my body , and what I should be I knew I should be of my body .\n",
      "6 It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall , The dark threw its patches down upon me also , The best I had done seem ' d to me blank and suspicious , My great thoughts as I supposed them , were they not in reality meagre ? Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil , I am he who knew what it was to be evil , I too knitted the old knot of contrariety , Blabb ' d , blush ' d , resented , lied , stole , grudg ' d , Had guile , anger , lust , hot wishes I dared not speak , Was wayward , vain , greedy , shallow , sly , cowardly , malignant , The wolf , the snake , the hog , not wanting in me . The cheating look , the frivolous word , the adulterous wish , not wanting ,\n",
      "Refusals , hates , postponements , meanness , laziness , none of these wanting , Was one with the rest , the days and haps of the rest , Was call ' d by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me approaching or passing , Felt their arms on my neck as I stood , or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as I sat , Saw many I loved in the street or ferry - boat or public assembly , yet never told them a word , Lived the same life with the rest , the same old laughing , gnawing , sleeping , Play ' d the part that still looks back on the actor or actress , The same old role , the role that is what we make it , as great as we like , Or as small as we like , or both great and small .\n",
      "7 Closer yet I approach you , What thought you have of me now , I had as much of you -- I laid in my stores in advance , I consider ' d long and seriously of you before you were born .\n",
      "Who was to know what should come home to me ? Who knows but I am enjoying this ? Who knows , for all the distance , but I am as good as looking at you now , for all you cannot see me ?\n",
      "8 Ah , what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than mast - hemm ' d Manhattan ? River and sunset and scallop - edg ' d waves of flood - tide ? The sea - gulls oscillating their bodies , the hay - boat in the twilight , and the belated lighter ? What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand , and with voices I love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as approach ? What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that looks in my face ? Which fuses me into you now , and pours my meaning into you ?\n",

Gorgeous clouds of the sunset ! drench with your splendor me , or the men and women generations after me ! Cross from shore to shore , countless crowds of passengers ! Stand up , tall masts of Mannahatta ! stand up , beautiful hills of Brooklyn ! Throb , baffled and curious brain ! throw out questions and answers !

Play the old role , the role that is great or small according as one makes it ! Consider , you who peruse me , whether I may not in unknown ways be looking upon you ; Be firm , rail over the river , to support those who lean idly , yet haste with the hasting current ; Fly on , sea - birds ! fly sideways , or wheel in large circles high in the air ; Receive the summer sky , you water , and faithfully hold it till all downcast eyes have time to take it from you ! Diverge , fine spokes of light , from the shape of my head , or any one ' s head , in the sunlit water ! Come on , ships from the lower bay ! pass up or down , white - sail ' d schooners , sloops , lighters ! Flaunt away , flags of all nations ! be duly lower ' d at sunset !

      "The choppers heard not , the camp shanties echoed not , The quick - ear ' d teamsters and chain and jack - screw men heard not , As the wood - spirits came from their haunts of a thousand years to join the refrain , But in my soul I plainly heard .\n",

      "Did you guess any thing lived only its moment ? The world does not so exist , no parts palpable or impalpable so exist , No consummation exists without being from some long previous consummation , and that from some other , Without the farthest conceivable one coming a bit nearer the beginning than any .\n",

      "What is prudence is indivisible , Declines to separate one part of life from every part , Divides not the righteous from the unrighteous or the living from the dead , Matches every thought or act by its correlative , Knows no possible forgiveness or deputed atonement , Knows that the young man who composedly peril ' d his life and lost it has done exceedingly well for himself without doubt , That he who never peril ' d his life , but retains it to old age in riches and ease , has probably achiev ' d nothing for himself worth mentioning , Knows that only that person has really learn ' d who has learn ' d to prefer results , Who favors body and soul the same , Who perceives the indirect assuredly following the direct , Who in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither hurries nor avoids death .\n",

      "Darest thou now O soul , Walk out with me toward the unknown region , Where neither ground is for the feet nor any path to follow ?\n",
      "No map there , nor guide , Nor voice sounding , nor touch of human hand , Nor face with blooming flesh , nor lips , nor eyes , are in that land .\n",
      "I know it not O soul , Nor dost thou , all is a blank before us , All waits undream ' d of in that region , that inaccessible land .\n",
      "Till when the ties loosen , All but the ties eternal , Time and Space , Nor darkness , gravitation , sense , nor any bounds bounding us .\n",
      "Then we burst forth , we float , In Time and Space O soul , prepared for them , Equal , equipt at last , ( O joy ! O fruit of all !) them to fulfil O soul .\n",
      "} Whispers of Heavenly Death\n",
      "Whispers of heavenly death murmur ' d I hear , Labial gossip of night , sibilant chorals , Footsteps gently ascending , mystical breezes wafted soft and low , Ripples of unseen rivers , tides of a current flowing , forever flowing , ( Or is it the plashing of tears ? the measureless waters of human tears ?)\n",
      "I see , just see skyward , great cloud - masses , Mournfully slowly they roll , silently swelling and mixing , With at times a half - dimm ' d sadden ' d far - off star , Appearing and disappearing .\n",
      "( Some parturition rather , some solemn immortal birth ; On the frontiers to eyes impenetrable , Some soul is passing over .)\n",
      "} Chanting the Square Deific\n",
      "1 Chanting the square deific , out of the One advancing , out of the sides , Out of the old and new , out of the square entirely divine , Solid , four - sided , ( all the sides needed ,) from this side Jehovah am I , Old Brahm I , and I Saturnius am ; Not Time affects me -- I am Time , old , modern as any , Unpersuadable , relentless , executing righteous judgments , As the Earth , the Father , the brown old Kronos , with laws , Aged beyond computation , yet never new , ever with those mighty laws rolling , Relentless I forgive no man -- whoever sins dies -- I will have that man ' s life ; Therefore let none expect mercy -- have the seasons , gravitation , the appointed days , mercy ? no more have I , But as the seasons and gravitation , and as all the appointed days that forgive not , I dispense from this side judgments inexorable without the least remorse .\n",
      "2 Consolator most mild , the promis ' d one advancing , With gentle hand extended , the mightier God am I , Foretold by prophets and poets in their most rapt prophecies and poems , From this side , lo ! the Lord Christ gazes -- lo ! Hermes I -- lo ! mine is Hercules ' face , All sorrow , labor , suffering , I , tallying it , absorb in myself , Many times have I been rejected , taunted , put in prison , and crucified , and many times shall be again , All the world have I given up for my dear brothers ' and sisters ' sake , for the soul ' s sake , Wanding my way through the homes of men , rich or poor , with the kiss of affection , For I am affection , I am the cheer - bringing God , with hope and all - enclosing charity , With indulgent words as to children , with fresh and sane words , mine only , Young and strong I pass knowing well I am destin ' d myself to an early death ; But my charity has no death -- my wisdom dies not , neither early nor late , And my sweet love bequeath ' d here and elsewhere never dies .\n",
      "3 Aloof , dissatisfied , plotting revolt , Comrade of criminals , brother of slaves , Crafty , despised , a drudge , ignorant , With sudra face and worn brow , black , but in the depths of my heart , proud as any , Lifted now and always against whoever scorning assumes to rule me , Morose , full of guile , full of reminiscences , brooding , with many wiles , ( Though it was thought I was baffled , and dispel ' d , and my wiles done , but that will never be ,) Defiant , I , Satan , still live , still utter words , in new lands duly appearing , ( and old ones also ,) Permanent here from my side , warlike , equal with any , real as any , Nor time nor change shall ever change me or my words .\n",
      "4 Santa Spirita , breather , life , Beyond the light , lighter than light , Beyond the flames of hell , joyous , leaping easily above hell , Beyond Paradise , perfumed solely with mine own perfume , Including all life on earth , touching , including God , including Saviour and Satan , Ethereal , pervading all , ( for without me what were all ? what were God ?) Essence of forms , life of the real identities , permanent , positive , ( namely the unseen ,) Life of the great round world , the sun and stars , and of man , I , the general soul , Here the square finishing , the solid , I the most solid , Breathe my breath also through these songs .\n",
      "} Of Him I Love Day and Night\n",
      "Of him I love day and night I dream ' d I heard he was dead , And I dream ' d I went where they had buried him I love , but he was not in that place , And I dream ' d I wander ' d searching among burial - places to find him , And I found that every place was a burial - place ; The houses full of life were equally full of death , ( this house is now ,) The streets , the shipping , the places of amusement , the Chicago , Boston , Philadelphia , the Mannahatta , were as full of the dead as of the living , And fuller , O vastly fuller of the dead than of the living ; And what I dream ' d I will henceforth tell to every person and age , And I stand henceforth bound to what I dream ' d , And now I am willing to disregard burial - places and dispense with them , And if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently everywhere , even in the room where I eat or sleep , I should be satisfied , And if the corpse of any one I love , or if my own corpse , be duly render ' d to powder and pour ' d in the sea , I shall be satisfied , Or if it be distributed to the winds I shall be satisfied .\n",
      "} Yet , Yet , Ye Downcast Hours\n",
      "Yet , yet , ye downcast hours , I know ye also , Weights of lead , how ye clog and cling at my ankles , Earth to a chamber of mourning turns -- I hear the o ' erweening , mocking voice , Matter is conqueror -- matter , triumphant only , continues onward .\n",
      "Despairing cries float ceaselessly toward me , The call of my nearest lover , putting forth , alarm ' d , uncertain , The sea I am quickly to sail , come tell me , Come tell me where I am speeding , tell me my destination .\n",
      "I understand your anguish , but I cannot help you , I approach , hear , behold , the sad mouth , the look out of the eyes , your mute inquiry , Whither I go from the bed I recline on , come tell me ,-- Old age , alarm ' d , uncertain -- a young woman ' s voice , appealing to me for comfort ; A young man ' s voice , Shall I not escape ?\n",
      "} As If a Phantom Caress ' d Me\n",
      "As if a phantom caress ' d me , I thought I was not alone walking here by the shore ; But the one I thought was with me as now I walk by the shore , the one I loved that caress ' d me , As I lean and look through the glimmering light , that one has utterly disappear ' d . And those appear that are hateful to me and mock me .\n",
      "} Assurances\n",
      "I need no assurances , I am a man who is preoccupied of his own soul ; I do not doubt that from under the feet and beside the hands and face I am cognizant of , are now looking faces I am not cognizant of , calm and actual faces , I do not doubt but the majesty and beauty of the world are latent in any iota of the world , I do not doubt I am limitless , and that the universes are limitless , in vain I try to think how limitless , I do not doubt that the orbs and the systems of orbs play their swift sports through the air on purpose , and that I shall one day be eligible to do as much as they , and more than they , I do not doubt that temporary affairs keep on and on millions of years , I do not doubt interiors have their interiors , and exteriors have their exteriors , and that the eyesight has another eyesight , and the hearing another hearing , and the voice another voice , I do not doubt that the passionately - wept deaths of young men are provided for , and that the deaths of young women and the deaths of little children are provided for , ( Did you think Life was so well provided for , and Death , the purport of all Life , is not well provided for ?) I do not doubt that wrecks at sea , no matter what the horrors of them , no matter whose wife , child , husband , father , lover , has gone down , are provided for , to the minutest points , I do not doubt that whatever can possibly happen anywhere at any time , is provided for in the inherences of things , I do not think Life provides for all and for Time and Space , but I believe Heavenly Death provides for all .\n",
      "} Quicksand Years\n",
      "Quicksand years that whirl me I know not whither , Your schemes , politics , fail , lines give way , substances mock and elude me , Only the theme I sing , the great and strong - possess ' d soul , eludes not , One ' s - self must never give way -- that is the final substance -- that out of all is sure , Out of politics , triumphs , battles , life , what at last finally remains ? When shows break up what but One ' s - Self is sure ?\n",
      "} That Music Always Round Me\n",
      "That music always round me , unceasing , unbeginning , yet long untaught I did not hear , But now the chorus I hear and am elated , A tenor , strong , ascending with power and health , with glad notes of daybreak I hear , A soprano at intervals sailing buoyantly over the tops of immense waves , A transparent base shuddering lusciously under and through the universe , The triumphant tutti , the funeral wailings with sweet flutes and violins , all these I fill myself with , I hear not the volumes of sound merely , I am moved by the exquisite meanings , I listen to the different voices winding in and out , striving , contending with fiery vehemence to excel each other in emotion ; I do not think the performers know themselves -- but now I think begin to know them .\n",
      "} What Ship Puzzled at Sea\n",
      "What ship puzzled at sea , cons for the true reckoning ? Or coming in , to avoid the bars and follow the channel a perfect pilot needs ? Here , sailor ! here , ship ! take aboard the most perfect pilot , Whom , in a little boat , putting off and rowing , I hailing you offer .\n",
      "} A Noiseless Patient Spider\n",
      "A noiseless patient spider , I mark ' d where on a little promontory it stood isolated , Mark ' d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding , It launch ' d forth filament , filament , filament out of itself , Ever unreeling them , ever tirelessly speeding them .\n",
      "And you O my soul where you stand , Surrounded , detached , in measureless oceans of space , Ceaselessly musing , venturing , throwing , seeking the spheres to connect them , Till the bridge you will need be form ' d , till the ductile anchor hold , Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere , O my soul .\n",
      "} O Living Always , Always Dying\n",
      "O living always , always dying ! O the burials of me past and present , O me while I stride ahead , material , visible , imperious as ever ; O me , what I was for years , now dead , ( I lament not , I am content ;) O to disengage myself from those corpses of me , which I turn and look at where I cast them , To pass on , ( O living ! always living !) and leave the corpses behind .\n",
      "} To One Shortly to Die\n",
      "From all the rest I single out you , having a message for you , You are to die -- let others tell you what they please , I cannot prevaricate , I am exact and merciless , but I love you -- there is no escape for you .\n",
      "Softly I lay my right hand upon you , you ' ust feel it , I do not argue , I bend my head close and half envelop it , I sit quietly by , I remain faithful , I am more than nurse , more than parent or neighbor , I absolve you from all except yourself spiritual bodily , that is eternal , you yourself will surely escape , The corpse you will leave will be but excrementitious .\n",
      "The sun bursts through in unlooked - for directions , Strong thoughts fill you and confidence , you smile , You forget you are sick , as I forget you are sick , You do not see the medicines , you do not mind the weeping friends , I am with you , I exclude others from you , there is nothing to be commiserated , I do not commiserate , I congratulate you .\n",
      "} Night on the Prairies\n",
      "Night on the prairies , The supper is over , the fire on the ground burns low , The wearied emigrants sleep , wrapt in their blankets ; I walk by myself -- I stand and look at the stars , which I think now never realized before .\n",
      "Now I absorb immortality and peace , I admire death and test propositions .\n",
      "How plenteous ! how spiritual ! how resume ! The same old man and soul -- the same old aspirations , and the same content .\n",
      "I was thinking the day most splendid till I saw what the not - day exhibited , I was thinking this globe enough till there sprang out so noiseless around me myriads of other globes .\n",
      "Now while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me I will measure myself by them , And now touch ' d with the lives of other globes arrived as far along as those of the earth , Or waiting to arrive , or pass ' d on farther than those of the earth , I henceforth no more ignore them than I ignore my own life , Or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine , or waiting to arrive .\n",
      "O I see now that life cannot exhibit all to me , as the day cannot , I see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death .\n",
      "} Thought\n",
      "As I sit with others at a great feast , suddenly while the music is playing , To my mind , ( whence it comes I know not ,) spectral in mist of a wreck at sea , Of certain ships , how they sail from port with flying streamers and wafted kisses , and that is the last of them , Of the solemn and murky mystery about the fate of the President , Of the flower of the marine science of fifty generations founder ' d off the Northeast coast and going down -- of the steamship Arctic going down , Of the veil ' d tableau - women gather ' d together on deck , pale , heroic , waiting the moment that draws so close -- O the moment !\n",
      "A huge sob -- a few bubbles -- the white foam spirting up -- and then the women gone , Sinking there while the passionless wet flows on -- and I now pondering , Are those women indeed gone ? Are souls drown ' d and destroy ' d so ? Is only matter triumphant ?\n",
      "} The Last Invocation\n",
      "At the last , tenderly , From the walls of the powerful fortress ' d house , From the clasp of the knitted locks , from the keep of the well - closed doors , Let me be wafted .\n",
      "Let me glide noiselessly forth ; With the key of softness unlock the locks -- with a whisper , Set ope the doors O soul .\n",
      "Tenderly -- be not impatient , ( Strong is your hold O mortal flesh , Strong is your hold O love .)\n",
      "} As I Watch the Ploughman Ploughing\n",
      "As I watch ' d the ploughman ploughing , Or the sower sowing in the fields , or the harvester harvesting , I saw there too , O life and death , your analogies ; ( Life , life is the tillage , and Death is the harvest according .)\n",
      "} Pensive and Faltering\n",
      "Pensive and faltering , The words the Dead I write , For living are the Dead , ( Haply the only living , only real , And I the apparition , I the spectre .)\n",

      "} Thou Mother with Thy Equal Brood\n",
      "1 Thou Mother with thy equal brood , Thou varied chain of different States , yet one identity only , A special song before I go I ' d sing o ' er all the rest , For thee , the future .\n",
      "I ' d sow a seed for thee of endless Nationality , I ' d fashion thy ensemble including body and soul , I ' d show away ahead thy real Union , and how it may be accomplish ' d .\n",
      "The paths to the house I seek to make , But leave to those to come the house itself .\n",
      "Belief I sing , and preparation ; As Life and Nature are not great with reference to the present only , But greater still from what is yet to come , Out of that formula for thee I sing .\n",
      "2 As a strong bird on pinions free , Joyous , the amplest spaces heavenward cleaving , Such be the thought I ' d think of thee America , Such be the recitative I ' d bring for thee .\n",
      "The conceits of the poets of other lands I ' d bring thee not , Nor the compliments that have served their turn so long , Nor rhyme , nor the classics , nor perfume of foreign court or indoor library ; But an odor I ' d bring as from forests of pine in Maine , or breath of an Illinois prairie , With open airs of Virginia or Georgia or Tennessee , or from Texas uplands , or Florida ' s glades , Or the Saguenay ' s black stream , or the wide blue spread of Huron , With presentment of Yellowstone ' s scenes , or Yosemite , And murmuring under , pervading all , I ' d bring the rustling sea - sound , That endlessly sounds from the two Great Seas of the world .\n",
      "And for thy subtler sense subtler refrains dread Mother , Preludes of intellect tallying these and thee , mind - formulas fitted for thee , real and sane and large as these and thee , Thou ! mounting higher , diving deeper than we knew , thou transcendental Union ! By thee fact to be justified , blended with thought , Thought of man justified , blended with God , Through thy idea , lo , the immortal reality ! Through thy reality , lo , the immortal idea !\n",
      "3 Brain of the New World , what a task is thine , To formulate the Modern -- out of the peerless grandeur of the modern , Out of thyself , comprising science , to recast poems , churches , art , ( Recast , may - be discard them , end them -- maybe their work is done , who knows ?) By vision , hand , conception , on the background of the mighty past , the dead , To limn with absolute faith the mighty living present .\n",

      "How the great cities appear -- how the Democratic masses , turbulent , willful , as I love them , How the whirl , the contest , the wrestle of evil with good , the sounding and resounding , keep on and on , How society waits unform ' d , and is for a while between things ended and things begun , How America is the continent of glories , and of the triumph of freedom and of the Democracies , and of the fruits of society , and of all that is begun , And how the States are complete in themselves -- and how all triumphs and glories are complete in themselves , to lead onward , And how these of mine and of the States will in their turn be convuls ' d , and serve other parturitions and transitions , And how all people , sights , combinations , the democratic masses too , serve -- and how every fact , and war itself , with all its horrors , serves , And how now or at any time each serves the exquisite transition of death .\n",
